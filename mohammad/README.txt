First of all, in index.html ,I added the favIcon in line 7 with <link> tag.Then I used a <nav> tag in order to create the navigation bar.After that I used <ul> tag to create an unordered list and aside that I used <li>tag to add the list items.Thereupon I added a header and after that I used an <img> tag to add an image.After I added the image I started an unordered list and concluded the page with the <footer> tag.
